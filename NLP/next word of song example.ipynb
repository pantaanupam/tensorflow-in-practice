levitating\\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\\nI make

Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\\nAngels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me\\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\\nAnd understand the discrimination\\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\\nDon't mistake it for Satan\\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\\nBe a king?
